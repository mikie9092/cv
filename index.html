                <p>Home Health Aide from <strong>2010 to 2012</strong>. working as a Home Health Aide I learned a lot
                    about the Elderly. i helped with assisted living. While i was in the clients home I learned all
                    about them. My time being an Aide was full of laughter and good food.</p>

                <h3>Warehouse</h3>
                <p>
                    Used Fork-lifts,tuggers,pallet jacks, RF devices in warehouse settings from
                    <strong>
                        2012 to 2017
                    </strong>. My time at my warehouse work help me to learn how to drive many warehouse equipment.
                    productivity and safety was very important. warehouse work lead me to think about becoming a truck
                    driver.

                <h3>CDL A</h3>
                <p> Drive Trucks since
                    <strong>
                        2017
                    </strong>
                    Becoming a Truck Driver has been the hardest and thought provoking career I been in thus far. Some
                    many hats I have to wear while driving a truck is taxing. Knowing the weather, traffic changes,
                    recent accidents, and places to take a break safely is a lot. Being a truck driver help me think of
                    safety in a different light. Driving safe is my only focus. My head is always on a swivel and always
                    predicting traffic patterns so I can make it back home safe.
